<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

What started as a hackathon project in college with friends has kept me busy over the years. It has seen many major rewrites, being the playground for my interest in various technology. The goal has always been the same: create a shared play queue with friends.

- [TinyBase](https://tinybase.org)
- [PartyKit](https://partykit.io)
